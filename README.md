# Introduction to Bioinformatics

This is an introduction to several different bioinformatics analysis methods. If you are brand new to R and RStudio, then start with the R Tutorial first. Once you've completed that, then you should try making graphs and tables using other datasets. There are plenty of other datasets built into R, in R packages, and free for download.

# Phylogenetics
The second tutorial is an introduction to phylogenetics. In this tutorial, we use the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene to create a phylogeny of bivalves with two species (a gastropod and a cephalopod) as an outgroup. We will create phylogenies uses several different methods in R and then two other methods outside of R (RAxML, BEAST2). After learning how to make a phylogeny, we will use ancestral state reconstruction to determine if the ancestral bivalve was gonochoristic (separate sexes) or hermaphroditic (can produce male and female gametes) and if it exhibited the phenomeenon of Doubly Uniparental Inheritance (DUI) where the offspring inherit mitochondria from both parents, rather than just the mother.

Download the entire Phylogenetics_Tutorial folder. You can open the .html file see and go through the tutorial. I've also included a .md file so you can see the tutorial directly in GitHub.

# RNAseq
Stay tuned for a third tutorial on RNAseq where we will analyze sex-specific expression patterns in _Mytilus edulis_ from Canada.
